Devlog files
============

Devlog is my personal project done mostly as a playground for different things
related to web application development with Flask and architecting software in
general.

Speaking of functionality, the application implements or is implementing
*simple blog*:

* authentication
* authorization
* inline content management
* stric and extensible content access management

Please note this application does not strive to be neither complete nor even
working. It's just a playground. Initial plan was to deploy this application as
a part of zgodowie.org service similar to Brewlog, but this may be postponed.
