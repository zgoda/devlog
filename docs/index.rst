Devlog files
============

Devlog is my personal project done mostly as a playground for different things
related to web application development with Flask and architecting software in
general. Other goal is to make *ideal package* of Flask based web application,
with clean structure and modern tooling. I'm almost there with that.

Speaking of functionality, the application implements or aims to implement
*simple blog*:

* authentication
* authorization
* inline content management (no *admin interface*)
* strict and extensible content access management

Please note this application does not strive to be neither complete nor even
working. It's just a playground. Initial plan was to deploy this application as
a part of zgodowie.org service similar to
`Brewlog <https://brewlog.zgodowie.org>`_, but this may be postponed or may
even never happen. The code is what matters here.
