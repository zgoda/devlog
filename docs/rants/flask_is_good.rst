Flask is A Good Thing
=====================

Let's get things straight - `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_ is
not *good micro framework*. Its code base is small but you won't feel that
*micro*  normally. Not at all, average application memory footprint will be on
par with similar Django application. It may be somewhat faster, but by a tiny
margin. This is not the reason why Flask Is A Good Thing (and Django is not,
at leasts compared to Flask).
