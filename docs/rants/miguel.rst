Muguel Grindberg is your man
============================

There are many good guys writing programming tutorials. Some of them are good,
others are *meh* but there is one that stands out of the crowd, at least when
you want to get some precious knowledge on Flask and related stuff.

Meet `Miguel Grindberg <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/about-me>`_, an
Argentinian guy from Portland, OR currently living in Ireland.

Miguel authored first
`mega-tutorial for Flask <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world>`_,
a piece that ran from installing Python to complete deployable application.
The series covered all good practices of Flask application development, from
project structure to testing and setting actual application runtime
environment. I'm not saying anything but compare that to most other Flask
tutorials one may find on the net. A real gem.
This is invaluable source of knowledge, not only for beginners,
but also seasoned Python devs will get their 'a-ha!' moments. The
`Django introductory tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/>`_
was great, but Miguel's tutorial was even better. More of all good things.
Did I say Flask encourages good application development practices? It does,
*au contraire* to Django. Let's just stop at application installability. But I
will revisit this topic in :doc:`another article </rants/flask_is_good>` and
now let's get back to our man.

Why such laudation?

While working on Devlog I found that often my idea of doing something with
application ends with 'hmm, let's check how Miguel did that' and Miguel
usually provides similar solution but in some ways better than my initial
idea. And then finally there was couple issues that I thought of 'hey, this
should be doable, didn't anyone tried that yet?' and it appears that yes, of
course, Miguel has a lenghty article on that topic in his blog, and it
describes everything in such great detail that the only thing is left is to
sit with editor and do what uncle Miguel said.

It's really encouraging when you see someone sharing some really serious
knowledge, and this is really Good Knowledge. So don't be put apart by series
title, tutorials are not only for beginners. Go read Miguel's mega tutorial,
and prosper from it. You will find even more great insights
`in his blog <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/index>`_.
