To be considered
================

Things that may be worth considering to be implemeneted/integrated as part of
this project. Or just interesting.

Resource Access Control
-----------------------

* `Vakt <https://github.com/kolotaev/vakt>`_ implements Attribute Based Access
  Control (ABAC).
* `Casbin <https://pypi.org/project/casbin/>`_ implements Role Based Access
  Control (RBAC)

Or prepare somethig that would be better suited for projects of this size
because both RBAC and ABAC are big things that don't scale down well - there is
large beginning processing overhead. Perhaps something losely resembling ABAC.
