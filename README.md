# Devlog

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/zgoda/devlog/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/zgoda/devlog) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/zgoda/devlog/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/zgoda/devlog?branch=master)

My dev log and other logs.

This is mostly idea and tools testing project for applications I'm developing at work, not necessarily web applications. And generally architecting software systems.

Free form documentation is on [my github pages](https://zgoda.github.io/devlog).

## Habla habla

* [code of conduct](docs/coc.rst)
* [contributing guidelines](docs/contributing.rst)

Apparently the COC document does not boost this project's _community status_ because it does not conform to Github _community standard_. Although they seem to be fine with my contributing guidelines.

## Governance

This is **not** a community project.
